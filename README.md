Summary: We've used two structures to organize, sort, and search imported census and COVID-19 data. Structures used are an m-ary search tree and hashtable.

//Please review how to use branches in the guide so we can make changes without overwriting previous files and also view a summary of the changes made to each file.

//As this is only my second time using github, I'm practicing on this readme.

// I am testing github
